  A first appointment, often called an initial consultation, is the preliminary
  meeting between an individual and a professional. This session allows both
  parties to get acquainted, assess the individual's needs and goals, and set
  expectations for future interactions. It's a crucial step in building trust
  and outlining the course of action or treatment. The specifics of the
  appointment can vary based on the context, from medical assessments to
  financial planning discussions.
